# Advent Of Code 2020
This repository is set up to keep a record of my personal progress on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) from year 2020.

# What's Advent Of Code?
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
